class CommWidget(DOMWidget):
    r"""
    A widget that has a direct Comm channel to each of its representations in the frontend.

    Normally, widgets use the traitlet mechanism to talk between the
    JavaScript frontend and the Python backend. While this is great for many
    applications, this kind of communication is too slow for real time
    streaming of measurement data in practice. Also Comms are easily saturated
    when using the traitlets mechanism and it is hard to keep everything
    responsive. Using a Comm directly, allows us to have better control over
    these communication channels. However, actually directly using a Comm can
    be a bit tedious, so this class provides a widget with a wrapper, namely a
    `Client` for each frontend widget that is attached to this widget.
